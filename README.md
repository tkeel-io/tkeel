TKeel addresses the key requirements for building a high-performance, pluginable data access platform.

It leverages the microservice architecture pattern and provides a pluggable architecture and a high-speed data plane to help you quickly build robust and reusable IoT solutions.

TKeel handles the complexity of distributed systems and provides simpler programmable abstractions to build.
